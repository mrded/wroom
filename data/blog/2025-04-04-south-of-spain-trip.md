7th to 15th May. 

Or 

8th to 17th May 2025
Duration: 10 days (7 days riding in Spain, 3 days on a ferry crossing)

## Where?

2 nights in the middle of Spain - most probably staying around Madrid - check out Avila. 4 or 5 nights staying the South of Spain at my place in Salobrena. Trips to Nerja (Ayo's amazing paella place on the beach); Rhonda (check out the gap); Apujarra mountain villages (ie. Capileira); southern rides along the coast.

## Weather?
Average temperatures in the South of Spain during May are 25C. The north of the country is cooler at around 15C. 

## How much?

Cost Estimate: £1,500 per person (includes ferry, food, fuel, and 2 nights’ accommodation in northern Spain)
Add £150 if taking the Plymouth to Santander ferry

## Transport

Return ferry (1 night on the ferry) - Plymouth to Santander. £625 per person. With motorbike & shared cabin

Or 

Return ferry from Portsmouth to Bilbao (aprox £500 per person with a motorcycle and shared cabin). Ride from Bilbao to Salobrena in the south, which is around 600 miles depending on the route. 

London to Portsmouth - 80 miles
London to Plymouth - 225 miles

### Staying

2 nights accommodation needed in the north of Spain (1 night each way). The remaining 4 or 5 nights will be at my apartment on the beach in Salobrena, which will serve as our base. There'll be no cost for this. You'll just need to cover your food and drink at local cafes & bars. I can accommodate 5 people. If there are more than 5, local accommodation will need to be rented at additional cost.


### Navigation

Route from Bilbao to Salobrena (do this over a 2 day ride to take in some of northern/central Spain). Day trips from Salobrena to places such as Rhonda, Capileira, Sierra Nevada and beaches on the south coast via some great roads, of course
