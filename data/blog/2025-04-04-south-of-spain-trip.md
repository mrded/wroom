## When?

Based on the average temperatures in the south of Spain and the ferry crossing timetable from Portsmouth, I'm proposing 12th to 21st September inclusive.
I've added some average annual temp charts for the north, middle & south of Spain and the Brittany ferry timetables for September sailings.

## Option - Flight & Motorcycle Hire
There's also a flight and bike hire option that some may want to consider. The LMRC group run regular trips to the south of Spain, flying to Malaga and using a local bike hire company. The hire company can collect you from the airport. But this may only be an option for groups. Depending on when you fly, return flights from London to Malaga can be as low as £100.

## Must Haves!

I'm putting this section upfront so it's not missed. I'll update this as we go. If you have any suggestions please let me know. Use this Bennetts guide for details https://www.bennetts.co.uk/bikesocial/news-and-views/features/travel/how-ride-motorcycle-europe?form=MG0AV3

### If riding your own motorcycle:
    1. You need to have full European breakdown cover, which includes recovering your bike and yourself to the UK and/or repairs to get you moving again. The group will do everything possible to assist you get going again, but if we cannot help and your only option is to be recovered by your breakdown service, then you will need to continue on your own. I use RAC for breakdown - RAC European breakdown https://www.rac.co.uk/breakdown-cover/european-breakdown-cover
    2. You need full European motorcycle insurance cover. The Green card is no longer required, just ensure you carry your insurance certificate and that your insurance covers you for EU riding. Please don't fall foul of the Spanish police (Guarda Civil), who just don't like people
    3. In Spain you need to display a UK sticker for a UK registered motorcycle 

#### Other:

1. EHIC/GHIC - If you don't have one, apply for your new Global health card here (this takes about 2-4 weeks to arrive) https://www.nhs.uk/using-the-nhs/healthcare-abroad/apply-for-a-free-uk-global-health-insurance-card-ghic/
2. ETIAS Visa Waiver - I believe this is not starting until the end of 2026 to visit the EU. So not required for our trip
    

## Where?

2 nights in the middle of Spain - most probably staying around Madrid - check out Avila. 4 or 5 nights staying the South of Spain at my place in Salobrena. Trips to Nerja (Ayo's amazing paella place on the beach); Rhonda (check out the gap); Apujarra mountain villages (ie. Capileira); southern rides along the coast.

Other POI's en-route to the south of Spain - Potes, N621 road from https://www.adventurebikerider.com/motorcycling-in-northern-spain-and-portugal/

## Weather?

Will update depending when we go.


## How much?

Cost Estimate: £1,500 per person (includes ferry, food, fuel, and 2 nights’ accommodation in northern Spain)
Add £150 if taking the Plymouth to Santander ferry

## Transport

Return ferry (1 night on the ferry) - Plymouth to Santander. £625 per person. With motorbike & shared cabin

Or 

Return ferry from Portsmouth to Bilbao (approx £500 per person with a motorcycle and shared cabin). Ride from Bilbao to Salobrena in the south, which is around 600 miles depending on the route. 

London to Portsmouth - 80 miles
London to Plymouth - 225 miles

### Staying

2 nights accommodation needed in the north of Spain (1 night each way). The remaining 4 or 5 nights will be at my apartment on the beach in Salobrena, which will serve as our base. There'll be no cost for this. You'll just need to cover your food and drink at local cafes & bars. I can accommodate 5 people. If there are more than 5, local accommodation will need to be rented at additional cost.


### Navigation

Route from Bilbao to Salobrena (do this over a 2 day ride to take in some of northern/central Spain). Day trips from Salobrena to places such as Rhonda, Capileira, Sierra Nevada and beaches on the south coast via some great roads, of course
