## When?

8th to 17th May 2025
Duration: 10 days (7 days riding in Spain, 3 days on a ferry crossing)

## Where?

2 nights in the north of Spain - most probably staying in the Rioja region. 4 or 5 nights staying the South of Spain at my place in Salobrena.Trips to Nerja (Ayo's amazing paella place on the beach); Rhonda (check out the gap); Apujarra mountain villages (ie. Capileira)

## How much?

Cost Estimate: £1,500 per person (includes ferry, food, fuel, and 2 nights’ accommodation in northern Spain)

## Transport

Return ferry from Portsmouth to Santander (£500 per person with a motorcycle and shared cabin). Ride from Bilboa to Salobrena in the south, which is around 600 miles depending on the route. 

### Staying

2 nights accommodation needed in the north of Spain, near Bilbao for the ferry. Probably around the Rioja area. The remaining 4 or 5 nights will be at my apartment on the beach in Salobrena, which will serve as our base. There'll be no cost for this. You'll just need to cover your food and drink at local cafes & bars. I can accommodate 5 people. If there are more than 5, local accommodation will need to be rented at additional cost.


### Navigation

Route from Bilbao to Salobrena (do this over a 2 day ride to take in some of northern Spain). Day trips Routes Salobrena to places such as Rhonda, Capileira and beaches on the south coast.
