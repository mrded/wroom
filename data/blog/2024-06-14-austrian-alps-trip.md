- Saturday 22nd, all day riding to France, stay over night in a hotel.

## How much?

**Estimated Costs:**

- **Eurotunnel:** Return trip currently estimated at £100.
- **Accommodation in Austria:** Approx. £600-£700 for 5 nights in a hotel with breakfast for 2 people, which is about £300 per person if shared.
- **Travel to & from Austria Accommodation:** Estimated at £100 for 2 nights.
- **Total Estimated Cost:** About £500 per person for accommodation and Eurotunnel. This does not include fuel, food, and beverages.

**Note:**
Once we have a confirmed number of participants, we can look into booking an apartment for 3 or 4 people to reduce accommodation costs.
