## How?

Quick ride through France, Belgium with priority on Austria
Depending on mileage might stop in Germany too near Black Forest which is a nice area to ride anyway.

Staying in hotels

Bellow is a draft plan of what we want to do:

The plan is: (subject to change!)
- Leaving Friday 14th after work, getting to France.
- Saturday 15th, all day riding to Austria by fast routes.
- We are planning to rent two hotels in Austria, staying 3 days in each, exploring the area around.
- Saturday 21st, free day, potential rest day or local exploration based on group energy levels.
- Saturday 22nd, all day riding to France, stay over night in a hotel.
- Sunday 23rd, getting home

## How much?

**Estimated Costs: Very roughly between £1000 and £1500**

- **Eurotunnel:** Return trip currently estimated at £100.
- **Accommodation in Austria:** Approx. £600-£700 for 5 nights in a hotel with breakfast for 2 people, which is about £300 per person if shared.
- **Travel to & from Austria Accommodation:** Estimated at £100 for 2 nights.
- **Total Estimated Cost for items in this list:** £500 per person for accommodation and Eurotunnel. This does not include fuel, food, and beverages.


**Note:**
Once we have a confirmed number of participants, we can look into booking an apartment for 3 or 4 people to reduce accommodation costs.
