## Camping options

We will be staing at [The Bull i' th' Thorn](https://www.pitchup.com/campsites/England/Central/Derbyshire/Matlock/middlehills-farm-campsite/
) camp side.

Address: Ashbourne Road, Hurdlow, Derbyshire, England, SK17 9QQ
Phone: +44 1298 83718

We are going to book 2 Bell tents for two nights 15-17. TBC.
That gives us a room for 8 people.

At the moment we have booked only one Bell tent for 4 people for the first night. So that we can arrive late and not worring about making a tent during a night.
Bell tent is £60 per night, shared with 4 people.

There still an option to book a pitch for own tent, it's £30 per night. A pitch can be shared between two bikes/tents.
