We are going to stay in 2 Bell tents for two nights 15-17 Sept.
That gives us a room for 8 people.

We can arrive anytime, there are only 4 bell tents at *Highland* area, they will have "Dmitry" name. We can just crash into them.

Each tent will have fire place and benches, and some dry wood, we can always buy more.

Bell tents are off the ground on a wooden platform. I think it's gonna be well isolated, and warm to sleep in it.

There is a Pub in the camp side (just wanted to mention it)

At the moment one Bell tent has been booked for the first night, and verbally agreed to extend it for the second night. Will need to pay for one more night at the camp.
And another bell tent has been booked for both nights.

each bell tent is £60 per night, shared with 4 people. That makes it £240 in total. The amount will be split equally between people.

There still an option to book a pitch for own tent, it's £30 per night. A pitch can be shared between two bikes/tents.
