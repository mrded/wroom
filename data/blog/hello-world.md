The motivation for creating this website stems from the need to streamline and organise the often chaotic conversations that take place in our WhatsApp group. Here, we aim to provide a centralised platform where we can combine and summarise these discussions, making it easier for everyone to stay informed and engaged.

In addition to facilitating smoother communication, we also plan to use this website as a space to share information about upcoming trips. Whether it's details about routes, meeting points, or even pictures from past adventures.

If you have ideas of how we should use this website - please suggest.
