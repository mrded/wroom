In Previous Episodes: [I accidentally bought a track motorcycle on eBay](https://bikepost.ru/blog/98341/Kak-ja-sluchajno-kupil-mototsikl-na-Ebay.html), and it was in somewhat shabby condition.

Now, the only thing left is to restore it. My restoration plan looked like this:

1. Check if the motorcycle works at all and compile a list of everything that needs replacing or repairing.
2. Perform basic maintenance to pass the MOT.
3. Prepare the motorcycle for the track—install protection and comply with regulations.
4. Replace broken parts with higher-quality ones where possible.
5. Optional modifications—if I have the energy and funds left.

#### Diagnostics

First, I sent the bike to a mechanic. His verdict: I was lucky—the damage was purely cosmetic. The frame and forks were intact, everything was straight.

Then came the smaller issues:

- New battery: £60
- Fluid changes: £260
- Light bulb: £12
- New front brake discs £249 and pads £46

The belts were also checked and appeared fine. Based on the mileage, it was still far from needing a desmo service.

So, the bike came back to life! However, most of the plastic panels, mirrors, and smaller parts needed attention.

To pass the MOT, I still needed a clutch lever and indicators. Time to hunt for spare parts online.

#### Passenger Footpegs

Passenger footpegs weren’t really necessary, but I got a used set for the sake of completeness: £48.

#### Seat

I found a spare seat as well. I didn’t really need it, but it was in better condition and fairly cheap: £38 used.

#### Mirrors

Finding mirrors on eBay proved challenging, as they had integrated indicators, which made them essential.

For a while, I had to ride like this:
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/spwxmpdlwm8ptdzl4oyt_smutfo.jpeg)

For some reason, only right mirrors were available for sale. Perhaps because most people drop their bikes on the left side, replacing and selling off the right mirrors to people like me.

I managed to buy a used right mirror for £100. The left one, however, wasn’t available on eBay, so I had to buy it directly from Ducati for £196.

#### Missing Plastic

The bike was missing the right panel under the seat, which also housed the seat access lock.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/slbzwjagzu87o2o3qvfvkawikiw.jpeg)

I found a broken panel in the correct colour and decided to glue it back together: £18 used.

#### Number Plate Holder

I found a tailpiece from a Panigale, which had the same number plate bracket spec: £25 used.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/27d3_rd6d3_8-sm-ufubzouyums.jpeg)

Later, I came across a short Evotech number plate holder. Why not? £70 used.

#### Lock/Key Set

The missing seat lock was a bother. Additionally, the fuel tank lock was worn out and needed the key to be inserted at a specific angle to open it.

I found a complete lock/key set from a wrecked bike: €224 used.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/v_ceno5hsqe8jomkzpnq7jqjwk0.jpeg)

The new keys, as expected, weren’t recognised by the bike, so I had to swap the chips from the original keys.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/30tokmllaqpdnmn-bus-wuvvqz0.jpeg)

Authorising the keys would’ve been an option, but swapping the chips was easier and cheaper.

#### Quick Shifter

Not essential, but a nice upgrade: €87 used.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/mkch_6jomv2gkz24xjviwejl09s.png)

I still haven’t fully adapted to it. Overall, it works well—gears shift up and down without the clutch—but sometimes I experience a “false neutral,” which is especially frustrating on the track at high speeds when shifting from 4th to 5th gear.

After researching the issue on forums and among other Ducati owners, I found that I’m not alone: https://www.ducatisupersport939.net/threads/false-neutral-in-5th-and-6th-gear.5161

Ducati’s official explanation is that this is a “racing” quick shifter and requires aggressive shifts. If the gear lever is nudged lightly rather than firmly engaged, this can happen.

There’s some truth to this, as the lever moves higher for upper gears, which might make it harder for me to reach. I’ve lowered the lever slightly—it’s a bit better now, but the problem persists. Still experimenting.

#### Tyres

The rear tyre already had a puncture, so I replaced both with Bridgestone S22: £380.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/m5qosgsdjswqnqknxw_xn8avadq.jpeg)

I really liked these tyres.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/p6wvb4iqjftvpvm8ltuhv41wbqm.jpeg)

#### Satnav Mount

Since I plan to ride to the track on my own, I needed navigation. TomTom mount: £53.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/uy60-ubr31iv2tge1unbyqzol1y.jpeg)

#### Sliders

Frame sliders: £300.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/u_n1sp55iu9fg-zyemketf2c7k0.jpeg)

Wheel sliders: £85.

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/h8i505yqjg-zykvy4fz_zmbm9x0.jpeg)

#### Brake/Clutch Lever Protection

Brake lever protection is mandatory for track approval.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/sj9kbibhkyouef06uwfpj2x-tjw.jpeg)

For symmetry, I bought them for both sides: £158.

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/gmlow3iazec3efjknvddkvmv3nc.jpeg)

#### Clutch Lever

Since the bike didn’t have a clutch lever at all, I had to buy a new one. Based on the part number, the clutch lever from a Ducati 821 Monster (63640022A) was compatible: £20 used.

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/av6zet0fz0rvglrdm7tdx_r7tti.jpeg)

#### Brake Lever

Initially, I kept the damaged brake lever:
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/ldzwtzsrxpota1wm9a0jbkpxydu.jpeg)

However, on the track, I was told this wasn’t acceptable. To make it look “safe,” I wrapped the lever with tape to mimic the ball at the end.

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/vktstxneumyfnghbandl5styfwk.png)

Eventually, I had to replace the brake lever. I initially bought a short ASV F3 lever:
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/cwp48awimhkpon8g5ddowv5rfj4.jpeg)

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/qwwc8yqdkrj4ssc1kwd0rjztn98.jpeg)

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/ue0iertuyfypb5hoy_aqebfd8ly.jpeg)

But I later realised I didn’t like the short lever, so I replaced it with a long ASV C5 lever: £110.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/5un1-rrxttfosfecs1oji0lrq8g.jpeg)

The ASV levers are like Swiss watches. The adjustment wheel clicks softly and smoothly. Fantastic levers—I’ll replace them straight away on any future bikes.

#### Clip-Ons

The left clip-on was slightly bent, so I replaced it even though it wasn’t strictly necessary: £53 used.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/lcibhylznhfvdgapywrr9nyjads.jpeg)

#### Air Filter

Installed a K&N filter: £58.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/oqpjwcm4-h_v0u1mjhig9jw-4tu.jpeg)

#### Exhaust Servo Motor

It turned out the exhaust servo motor, which operates the exhaust valve, was broken. Instead of repairing it, I simply removed it and installed a resistor bypass: £45.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/ralfkznqwzrznuekhwz4wtuu1na.jpeg)

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/mygx8cekfymm-rjiu_yezmjyusk.jpeg)

#### Exhaust

The stock exhaust began to irritate me as soon as I replaced the tyres. I’m not sure what Ducati engineers were thinking when they designed a single-sided swingarm and an exhaust that requires removal to access the rear wheel.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/1e6-ium-eth5dwc_3vougf7i_jw.jpeg)

The bolts, of course, were all rusted, and I realised something had to be done. Justifying the £2,418.23 cost of an Akrapovic exhaust wasn’t an option.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/vr9cw6jieqvf0ynww1uuk59cjje.jpeg)

So, I found a budget-friendly British brand—Delkevic 350mm Titanium X oval exhaust system: £150 used.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/pzpyyazl3v3rfqhmtc1dwnikab4.jpeg)

I removed the catalytic converter like a tumour.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/vrjytzrjeiiyoot6wgapd9i7sgk.jpeg)

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/bkxirdh2dtsq8fymgbdle4ge62q.jpeg)

While the exhaust can itself was titanium and well-made, the connecting pipes were thin steel.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/5ehwai517bwlompg2rktysmiur8.jpeg)

Soon enough, likely due to vibrations, a crack appeared at the joint.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/1hfhlu1gq-j-rpmonjwfqvk2naa.jpeg)

I had to weld it.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/gqficwdeub9k5vwmgwvepptkufa.jpeg)

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/-manv2brgdz_9yzabhybp-tgc2u.jpeg)

Another issue was that my heel would rest against the exhaust. I’ll need to figure out a solution for that.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/yy2flevqmmwrhdrfq9s31gtkfgy.jpeg)

The exhaust looks and sounds great. It’s also easy to remove.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/oa25hrgivxxl_jijy8sawdb2l8o.jpeg)

I was worried it might be too loud for the track, but it turned out to be within acceptable limits.

#### Plastic Panels

Most of the panels were damaged in some way. The main issue was broken mounting pins.

Initially, I considered buying new panels:
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/vpvqdpxrk1my8isronst3_q3wv8.jpeg)

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/p3jzwv-oz9cx0p8lu9bwkkcqx8s.jpeg)

If only one panel had been broken, I might have bought an OEM replacement. But buying an entire set didn’t make sense, so I decided to repair them with super glue and baking soda.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/o7kmcp1eir7gnge9kl-6ywdz_eo.jpeg)

It turned out pretty well.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/36xryy1zh9kk23jt3ixdpnr9m6u.jpeg)

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/byp1xccx-chl3cjbzl6tzt2dmoc.jpeg)

![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/w5aqgmmijhh6stylwhfgz_m35go.jpeg)

Later in the season, I bought an entire set of panels from China for the price of one OEM panel: £340.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/n8pdjql10bi6r5btwqf9atxkcqs.jpeg)

They arrived well-packaged.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/zwk8zsjklt2tc58vgedzvrmuya8.jpeg)

The colour matched the original perfectly (original and replica shown side-by-side):
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/pxqieau5vp0z5ttd_j6gnjh8oly.jpeg)

I suspect that the paint might scratch, but I showed the plastic to a friend who specialises in painting cars and motorcycles, and he assured me it would be fine.

At first, I thought about applying a clear coat on top or wrapping it in vinyl. However, that would have turned the matte finish into a glossy one. I decided to leave it as is. If it gets scratched, I’ll repaint it.

The plastic fits exactly like the original.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/vldsfpkxwsfrupwxkgszfqdskvc.jpeg)

The replica is slightly heavier because it’s made of ABS plastic.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/_szjaegcljr7jb7eou3wxghghke.jpeg)

A downside of ABS is that it melts, and Ducati bikes tend to run very hot. Thankfully, the kit came with thermal insulation—I hope it’ll prevent any issues.

#### Final Thoughts

In the end, the restoration cost me about the same as the price I paid for the bike itself. :)
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/0jisqg0nasodjgnaahffte9xdgs.jpeg)

To be honest, I could have added a bit more and bought a complete, undamaged motorcycle.
![](/static/blog/2025-01-13-glucati-ss-repair/nj14tcoqhhiupeczuq_6ywp6vi8.png)

I could also have done minimal repairs, which would have been enough for track use. Overall, I really enjoyed the entire restoration process. It was a year-long project. Additionally, the current budget and condition of the bike mean I don’t have to worry about every little scratch on the track.

I often meet people with Panigale V4s worth £30k who have never taken them to the track. Honestly, I understand them. I’d be overly cautious about such a bike too. It’s not particularly comfortable in the city, it’s useless for touring, and taking it to the track feels like a waste.

In conclusion, I have no regrets. This project brought me a lot of emotions, experience, and a capable track bike. In fact, I might even do something like this again.
