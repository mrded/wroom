The aim of this article is to compile all my complaints about using a mobile phone as a motorcycle navigator, in favour of a dedicated navigation device.

I am not promoting any specific navigator, I just want to highlight the inherent problems of using a phone as a navigation device on a motorcycle.

I have been asked for advice on motorcycle navigation multiple times, always assuming that the navigation must be done via a phone. I am tired of repeating myself, so I plan to simply share a link to this article in the future, where my subjective opinion on the topic is gathered.

## My Experience

I have been using a **TomTom Rider 450** since 2017, and I still have many complaints about it. I use it exclusively for long rides.

I also use an **iPhone** for navigation in the city and for short coffee runs.

I have tried all sorts of mounts from AliExpress. Currently, I use a **Quad Lock** with wireless charging and a vibration damper.

## Mobile Phone

### Pros

- Always with you and owned by everyone
- Fast interface, quick location search with internet access
- A huge selection of maps, some of which generate great routes

### Cons

- **Screen does not work in the rain**

  - Raindrops press on the screen, interfering with navigation
  - Zooming in and out becomes impossible
  - Locking the screen and stopping to adjust navigation is a bad idea. You need to find a dry spot to do this. Constantly stopping in a group is also frustrating

- **Charging via cable does not work in the rain**

  - I have thrown away countless corroded charging cables

- **Wireless charging is not a perfect solution**

  - Even though it is waterproof, it heats up and charges poorly. Wireless charging consumes more energy as part of it dissipates as heat
  - With navigation running (and sometimes constant network searching), wireless charging merely maintains the battery level rather than actually charging it

- **Phone interactivity issues**

  - If a message or call comes in, navigation often gets interrupted
  - If you need to make a call, navigation disappears

- **Not convenient to use with gloves**

  - I have had many gloves that supposedly work with phone screens. None of them worked properly. Some required tapping at a strange angle, some did not work at all
  - The phone interface is not designed for gloves. Small buttons and multi-touch zooming are a real challenge while wearing gloves

- **Vibrations damage the phone’s camera**
  - This can be solved with a vibration damper (but this is not 100% certain)
- **Inaccurate GPS and weak signal**

  - Phones typically have a **1Hz GPS refresh rate**, meaning they update location **once per second**. This results in speed readings that are predictive rather than real-time. This is especially concerning for motorcycles, where rapid acceleration and deceleration can lead to incorrect speed readings. **I wouldn't trust it near speed cameras.**
  - In contrast, **dedicated satnavs have a much higher GPS refresh rate and a stronger signal**, ensuring that your speed reading is accurate when passing speed cameras.
  - If you have ever used **Google Maps in big cities with skyscrapers**, you have probably noticed that navigation **glitches and jumps around** due to signal interference. Dedicated satnavs perform far better in these environments, providing **more stable and accurate positioning.**

- **Too many navigation apps, none of them perfect**
  - The wide variety of maps available on a phone is both a **blessing and a curse**. No single app does everything well. Some are great for offline use, some excel at finding the **fastest** routes, others have **the best navigation interface**, and so on.
  - On a motorcycle, **we don’t always want the fastest route**. Apps like **Google Maps and Waze** are excellent for city navigation but fail when it comes to planning scenic, enjoyable rides outside the city.
  - **Most apps require a constant internet connection**, which can be unreliable, especially in rural areas.
  - **Not all apps show speed cameras**.
  - **The best navigation apps aren’t free**. For example, **Calimoto**, one of the most popular motorcycle-specific apps, comes at a premium price.
  - Finding an app that does **everything** is nearly impossible, meaning you’ll **end up juggling multiple apps mid-trip**, which is both stressful and inconvenient while riding.

## Dedicated Navigator

Motorcycle-specific navigators like the **TomTom Rider 450/550** or **Garmin Zūmo XT** do not have the issues listed above. Therefore, I will go straight to the downsides:

### Cons

- **Navigators are slow**
  - Planning a route directly on the device is a nightmare
  - However, you can plan on a computer or phone, and syncing is very easy

## Cost Comparison

People often justify using a phone as a cheaper alternative to a **£300-£400** navigator.

Here is the cost just to connect a phone to a motorcycle (prices at 2023):

Now, add the cost of an **old iPhone X (~£160)**. Given that most people want to reuse their **main phone worth >£1,000**, it does not turn out to be such a cheap solution, especially considering the downsides I mentioned earlier.

Additionally, let’s consider the cost of purchasing maps for a phone to compare which option is actually cheaper.

**Calimoto** is one of the most popular apps for route planning in the UK. Buying maps for it costs **€249.99**, which is equivalent to the price of a dedicated navigator with pre-installed maps for the entire world.

I'll leave it for you to do the maths.

## Conclusion

Unfortunately, I see a trend where dedicated navigators are becoming less popular. Speaking with **TomTom support**, it seems they are also not interested in developing hardware that lasts for years and does not generate ongoing revenue.

When I asked whether there would be an update for the TomTom Rider, I was told that all efforts are focused on creating a **mobile app with a subscription model**. I understand the business motivation, but I think this is a huge mistake.

I have come to the conclusion that **a phone is great for short day trips or city riding**, while **a dedicated navigator is necessary for long trips and harsh conditions**. Swapping their roles will only lead to frustration.
